    "Q1. Is an assignment operator like += only for show? Is it possible that it would lead to faster results\n",
    "at the runtime?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS->\n",
    "The += operator is not just for show. It is a shorthand assignment operator that performs addition and assignment in a single step. It can lead to slightly faster results at runtime compared to using the full assignment expression. This is because the += operator can be more efficient in terms of memory and performance, especially when dealing with mutable objects like lists or arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. What is the smallest number of statements you&#39;d have to write in most programming languages to\n",
    "replace the Python expression a, b = a + b, a?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS->\n",
    "In most programming languages, you would need two statements to replace the Python expression `a, b = a + b, a`. One statement to store the sum of `a` and `b` in a temporary variable, and another statement to assign the temporary variable to both `a` and `b`.\n",

    "Q3. In Python, what is the most effective way to set a list of 100 integers to 0?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS->\n",
    "The most effective way to set a list of 100 integers to 0 in Python is by using a list comprehension:\n",
    "\n",
    "`my_list = [0] * 100`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. What is the most effective way to initialise a list of 99 integers that repeats the sequence 1, 2, 3?\n",
    "S If necessary, show step-by-step instructions on how to accomplish this.\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS-> \n",
    "The most effective way to initialize a list of 99 integers that repeats the sequence 1, 2, 3 is by using a list comprehension:\n",
    "\n",
    "`my_list = [i % 3 + 1 for i in range(99)]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5.If you&#39;re using IDLE to run a Python application, explain how to print a multidimensional list as\n",
    "efficiently?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS->\n",
    "To efficiently print a multidimensional list in IDLE, you can use nested loops to iterate through the rows and columns of the list and print each element. For example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]\n",
    "for row in matrix:\n",
    "    for element in row:\n",
    "        print(element, end=' ')\n",
    "    print()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. Is it possible to use list comprehension with a string? If so, how can you go about doing it?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS->\n",
    "Yes, you can use list comprehension with a string. You can use a string as the input sequence and apply operations to each character in the string. For example, `[ord(char) for char in \"hello\"]` would return a list of Unicode values of the characters in the string \"hello\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. From the command line, how do you get support with a user-written Python programme? Is this\n",
    "possible from inside IDLE?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS->\n",
    "To get support for a user-written Python program from the command line, you can use the `python -h` or `python --help` command to display the help information and command-line options. In IDLE, you can use the `help()` function to get help on modules, classes, functions, etc., or you can access the context-sensitive help through the GUI.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8. Functions are said to be “first-class objects” in Python but not in most other languages, such as\n",
    "C++ or Java. What can you do in Python with a function (callable object) that you can&#39;t do in C or\n",
    "C++?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS->\n",
    "In Python, functions are first-class objects, which means you can treat them like any other object. You can pass functions as arguments to other functions, return them from functions, store them in data structures, and assign them to variables. This level of flexibility is not as common in languages like C++ or Java, where functions are not typically treated as standalone objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q9. How do you distinguish between a wrapper, a wrapped feature, and a decorator?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS->\n",
    "In software development:\n",
    "- A **wrapper** is code that provides a simplified or more convenient interface to another component or library.\n",
    "- A **wrapped feature** is the original component or functionality that the wrapper is built around.\n",
    "- A **decorator** is a design pattern in Python that allows you to add behavior to functions or methods without altering their structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q10. If a function is a generator function, what does it return?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS->\n",
    "If a function is a generator function in Python, it doesn't return a value directly. Instead, it returns a generator object that can be used to iterate over the sequence of values that the generator function generates. The values are produced one at a time using the `yield` keyword within the generator function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q11. What is the one improvement that must be made to a function in order for it to become a\n",
    "generator function in the Python language?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS->\n",
    "To turn a regular function into a generator function, you need to replace `return` statements with `yield` statements. The `yield` keyword allows the function to \"pause\" its execution and remember its state, so it can resume from where it left off when iterated over.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q12. Identify at least one benefit of generators.\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS->\n",
    "One benefit of generators is that they are memory efficient. Generators produce values on-the-fly and do not store the entire sequence of values in memory, unlike lists. This makes generators suitable for dealing with large data sets or infinite sequences, as they only generate values when needed and can conserve memory resources."
