    "Q1. **Q1. Which two operator overloading methods can you use in your classes to support iteration?**\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS->\n",
    "To support iteration in your classes, you can use the following two operator overloading methods:\n",
    "- `__iter__(self)`: This method is used to define the behavior of the class when used in a for loop. It should return an iterator object, often the instance itself or a separate object with a `__next__` method.\n",
    "- `__next__(self)`: This method is used to define the behavior of obtaining the next item from the iterator. It should be implemented in conjunction with `__iter__` and raise `StopIteration` when there are no more items to iterate over.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. **Q2. In what contexts do the two operator overloading methods manage printing?**\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS->\n",
    "-The two operator overloading methods that manage printing are:\n",
    "- `__str__(self)`: This method should return a human-readable string representation of the object. It's used by functions like `str()` and `print()` to display the object.\n",
    "- `__repr__(self)`: This method should return an \"official\" string representation of the object, ideally one that could be used to recreate the object. It's used by the `repr()` function and is typically more detailed than `__str__`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. **Q3. In a class, how do you intercept slice operations?**\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS->\n",
    "To intercept slice operations in a class, you can define the `__getitem__(self, key)` method. The `key` parameter will be a slice object, and you can implement the slicing behavior as needed. For example, if you want to enable slicing on a list-like object, you can define `__getitem__` to handle slicing indices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. **Q4. In a class, how do you capture in-place addition?**\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS->\n",
    "To capture in-place addition (`+=`) in a class, you can define the `__iadd__(self, other)` method. This method is called when the `+=` operator is used with an instance of your class. You can implement the appropriate behavior to update the instance's attributes based on the addition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. **Q5. When is it appropriate to use operator overloading?**\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS->\n",
    "Operator overloading should be used when it enhances the readability and intuitiveness of your code. Some common scenarios include:\n",
    "- When your custom objects have natural mathematical or comparison relationships (e.g., vectors, matrices, complex numbers).\n",
    "- When your objects can be meaningfully added, subtracted, multiplied, or compared.\n",
    "- When you want to provide a more convenient or intuitive interface for users of your class.\n"
