    "Q1. Compare and contrast the float and Decimal classes&#39; benefits and drawbacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS->\n",
    "\n",
    " **Comparison of float and Decimal Classes**:\n",
    "   - **Benefits of `Decimal` Class**: It provides arbitrary precision decimal arithmetic, suitable for financial calculations where exact decimal representation is crucial.\n",
    "   - **Drawbacks of `Decimal` Class**: It's slower and requires more memory compared to `float`. Its operations may involve more computational overhead due to the precision handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. Decimal(&#39;1.200&#39;) and Decimal(&#39;1.2&#39;) are two objects to consider. In what sense are these the same\n",
    "object? Are these just two ways of representing the exact same value, or do they correspond to\n",
    "different internal states?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS->\n",
    "\n",
    "`Decimal('1.200')` and `Decimal('1.2')` are two different objects. They represent the same value, but the internal states may differ due to the way floating-point values are converted to `Decimal` objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. What happens if the equality of Decimal(&#39;1.200&#39;) and Decimal(&#39;1.2&#39;) is checked?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS->\n",
    "\n",
    "If the equality of `Decimal('1.200')` and `Decimal('1.2')` is checked, it will return `False`. This is because `Decimal` comparisons are based on exact decimal representation, and the trailing zeroes make them different.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. Why is it preferable to start a Decimal object with a string rather than a floating-point value?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS->\n",
    "\n",
    "It's preferable to start a `Decimal` object with a string rather than a floating-point value to avoid potential precision loss caused by the conversion of floating-point values to decimals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. In an arithmetic phrase, how simple is it to combine Decimal objects with integers?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS->\n",
    "\n",
    "Combining `Decimal` objects with integers in arithmetic operations is straightforward and follows the same principles as other numeric types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. Can Decimal objects and floating-point values be combined easily?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS->\n",
    "\n",
    "Combining `Decimal` objects with floating-point values might lead to some loss of precision due to inherent differences in representation. It's generally better to avoid mixing these types directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. Using the Fraction class but not the Decimal class, give an example of a quantity that can be\n",
    "expressed with absolute precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS->\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of a quantity that can be expressed with absolute precision using the `Fraction` class could be `Fraction(1, 3)` since `1/3` cannot be represented exactly in finite decimal form.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8. Describe a quantity that can be accurately expressed by the Decimal or Fraction classes but not by\n",
    "a floating-point value.\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS->\n",
    "\n",
    "A quantity like `0.1` cannot be accurately represented by a floating-point value due to the binary-based representation of floats. Both the `Decimal` and `Fraction` classes can accurately represent this value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q9.Consider the following two fraction objects: Fraction(1, 2) and Fraction(1, 2). (5, 10). Is the internal\n",
    "state of these two objects the same? Why do you think that is?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS->\n",
    "\n",
    "The internal state of `Fraction(1, 2)` and `Fraction(1, 2).limit_denominator(5)` will not be the same. The second fraction object is explicitly reduced to its simplest form, so their internal representations will differ.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q10. How do the Fraction class and the integer type (int) relate to each other? Containment or\n",
    "inheritance?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS->\n",
    " The `Fraction` class does not inherit from the `int` type. Instead, it allows for precise representation of rational numbers as fractions. Containment and inheritance don't apply here; they are separate types for different purposes."
