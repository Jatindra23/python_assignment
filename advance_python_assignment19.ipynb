    "Q1. **Class and Instances Relationship**:\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS->\n",
    "\n",
    "The relationship between a class and its instances is a one-to-many partnership. A class defines a blueprint or template for creating objects, and instances are individual objects created from that class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. **Data Held Only in an Instance**:\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS->\n",
    "\n",
    "Instance-specific data is held in instance variables. These variables store data unique to each instance and are defined within the class's methods, often using the `self` keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. **Knowledge Stored in a Class**:\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS->\n",
    "\n",
    "A class stores knowledge about its attributes (variables) and behaviors (methods) that its instances share. It encapsulates a common structure and functionality that instances can utilize.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. **Method vs. Regular Function**:\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS->\n",
    "\n",
    "A method is a function defined within a class that operates on its instances. It takes `self` as its first parameter to refer to the instance it's operating on. A regular function is not associated with any class and does not require an instance to operate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. **Inheritance in Python**:\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS->\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, inheritance is supported in Python. The syntax for inheritance is:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class ChildClass(ParentClass):\n",
    "    # Class definition\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. **Encapsulation in Python**:\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS->\n",
    "\n",
    "Python supports encapsulation to a certain extent by using naming conventions. Prefixing variables with a single underscore `_` implies they are meant to be treated as \"protected\" (not to be accessed outside the class) and using double underscore `__` makes them \"private\" (name-mangled to make them less accessible).\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. **Class Variable vs. Instance Variable**:\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS->\n",
    "\n",
    "A class variable is shared among all instances of a class, while an instance variable is specific to an individual instance. Class variables are defined outside of methods, while instance variables are defined within methods using `self`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8. **Self in Method Definitions**:\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS->\n",
    "\n",
    "`self` is included as the first parameter in a class's method definitions to refer to the instance on which the method is being called. It's necessary to include `self` in order to access instance-specific data and methods within the method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q9. **Difference between \\_\\_add\\_\\_ and \\_\\_radd\\_\\_**:\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS->\n",
    "\n",
    "- `__add__`: Defines the behavior of the `+` operator when the object is on the left side.\n",
    "- `__radd__`: Defines the behavior of the `+` operator when the object is on the right side.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q10. **Use of Reflection Methods**:\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS->\n",
    "\n",
    "Reflection methods like `__getattr__` and `__setattr__` allow customization of attribute access and assignment. You may not need them if you're satisfied with the default behavior of attribute access and assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q11. **\\_\\_iadd\\_\\_ Method**:\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS->\n",
    "\n",
    "`__iadd__` is called for `+=` operations. It's used to modify the object in-place and is part of the augmented assignment protocol.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q12. **\\_\\_init\\_\\_ Method Inheritance**:\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS->\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, the `__init__` method is inherited by subclasses. If you need to customize its behavior within a subclass, you can override it by defining a new `__init__` method in the subclass. To call the parent class's `__init__` method, use `super().__init__(...)`."
