    "Q1. **Greedy vs. Non-Greedy**:\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS->\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Greedy**: Matches as much as possible while still allowing the overall pattern to match.\n",
    "- **Non-Greedy (Lazy)**: Matches as little as possible while still allowing the pattern to match.\n",
    "\n",
    "To transform a greedy pattern into a non-greedy one, add a `?` after the quantifier (e.g., `*?`, `+?`, `??`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. **When Greedy vs. Non-Greedy Matters**:\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS->\n",
    "\n",
    "- Greedy vs. Non-Greedy matters when a pattern contains multiple possible matches and you want to control how much is consumed by a quantifier.\n",
    "- If only a greedy match is available, you can still use it and adjust your pattern or logic accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. **Non-Tagged Group in Simple Match**:\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS->\n",
    "\n",
    "- In simple matches without replacement, using a non-tagged group typically doesn't make a practical difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. **Scenario with Non-Tagged Category**:\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS->\n",
    "\n",
    "- Using a non-tagged category can impact the outcome when capturing and referencing group content separately from the whole match, as it changes the group numbering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. **Look-Ahead Without Consuming**:\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS->\n",
    "\n",
    "- Look-ahead condition could be used to validate if a certain condition follows without actually consuming those characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. **Positive vs. Negative Look-Ahead**:\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS->\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Positive Look-Ahead `(?!...)`**: Asserts that a sub-pattern doesn't follow the main pattern.\n",
    "- **Negative Look-Ahead `(?=...)`**: Asserts that a sub-pattern does follow the main pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. **Named Groups vs. Numbered Groups**:\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS->\n",
    "\n",
    "- Referring to groups by name improves code readability and makes the code more self-documenting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8. **Identifying Repeated Items Using Named Groups**:\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS->\n",
    "\n",
    "- Yes, you can use named groups and regular expressions to identify repeated items in a target string.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q9. **Scanner Interface vs. re.findall**:\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS->\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Scanner interface in Python can provide more control during parsing, allowing you to perform custom actions while scanning the string, unlike `re.findall()` which focuses on pattern matching.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q10. **Scanner Object Naming**:\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS->\n",
    "\n",
    "- No, a Scanner object does not have to be named \"scanner\". You can choose any valid variable name you prefer."
